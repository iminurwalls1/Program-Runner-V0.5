Welcome.





This is a program runner. This folder is virus free, you can check it yourself.
it is simple to make your code run and work in this inviroment. Sadly the program must be written in python.
This is the python version of the runner. The program needs to be put into a function, the imported libraries and pre-defined variables can stay like they are.
This runner doesnt run the whole file but just the function, in this case the program, beacuse its runner can not support file running.



Good job, you just unziped the folder!
I will now give you a quick tutorial on how to set up and run your own programs.
it is fairly easy to do so. Just follow these steps.

1. Put your file (program file) in the main folder
2. Open the "script_runner.py" file
3. Follow the instructions in the file
4. Delete the "example_program.py" file
5. Start the "main.py" file and you are ready to go!

Now that you have imported your code into the program, you can finish setting the program up.

If there is any text in "command_log.txt" file, DELETE IT, on the first running
If there are any errors and the program won't run, then i don't know what to tell you




Good luck with your programs.
